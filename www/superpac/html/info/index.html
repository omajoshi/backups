Introduction</h3>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">
On the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the
year two thousand nineteen of the common era, I, Om Joshi, filed with the
Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an independent-expenditure only
committee (commonly referred to as a super PAC).&nbsp; I decided to create this
committee because the filing process seemed easy and I enjoy immersing myself
in government documents that contain lots of rules and regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I named the committee <i>Om Alone PAC</i> because
that was the first name that came to me.<o:p></o:p></div>

What is a super PAC?</h3>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">
A super&nbsp;PAC is a special type of tax-exempt
political organization under Section 527 of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Code.&nbsp; Super PACs are different from regular PACs because they can receive
and spend unlimited amounts of money.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">
Super PACs were first introduced in 2010 by the
FEC in the aftermath of two federal court cases.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">
</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>First, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the
plaintiff in the landmark&nbsp;<i>Citizens United v. Federal Election
Commission</i>&nbsp;case, that the freedom of (political) speech granted to
individuals is also extended to corporations.&nbsp; This decision gave
corporations the right to spend unlimited amounts of money on elections
(treating money as an extension of free speech).</li>
<li>In the second case,&nbsp;<i>SpeechNow.org v. FEC</i>,
the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia applied&nbsp;<i>Citizens
United</i>&nbsp;to rule that it was unconstitutional to make SpeechNow, a
non-profit that would be making "independent expenditures"
independent of political candidates, to be subject to contribution
limits.&nbsp; The Court added that the ruling would only apply to independent
entities such as SpeechNow, which could now receive donations of unlimited
value; donations to political candidates would still be governed by existing
campaign finance laws and therefore retain existing contribution limits.&nbsp;
The Court, however, disagreed with SpeechNow's other argument that having to
register as a committee would violate its right to privacy, arguing that the
disclosure burden is insignificant "given the relative simplicity with
which SpeechNow intends to operate."</li>
</ul>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">
<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle">
In conjunction, these two rulings allowed
individuals, and by extension corporations, the right to donate unlimited
amounts of money to independent-expenditure only committees.&nbsp; However,
committees are still required to report all donations to the FEC.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpLast">
The biggest regulation on super&nbsp;PACs is that
they cannot coordinate with a political candidate or party.&nbsp; However,
there is a very high threshold to be considered "coordination," and
super PACs have in the past been run by former business partners of candidates.<o:p></o:p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
What steps did I take?</h3>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">
As stated above, the process is simple.&nbsp; Using
the FEC's online form system, I filled out&nbsp;<i>Form 1: Statement of
Organization</i>.&nbsp; I proceeded through a series of questions asking about
my affiliation to specific candidates or political parties, to which I
truthfully responded "No."&nbsp; I then filled in the details of the
committee, information such as the street address (my home address), email
address, and website.&nbsp; Next, I registered myself as the Treasurer, which
meant that I would be in charge of managing receipts and filing
documents.&nbsp; After that, I added my local Bank of America location as the
committee's most likely location of funds.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpLast">
Lastly, I added a text memo to the form stating that
the committee would be operating as an independent-expenditure only committee,
"consistent with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
decision in SpeechNow v. FEC."&nbsp; (The full text of my memo was easily
accessible on the FEC website and is intended to be copied verbatim onto the
form.)&nbsp; This memo is necessary to establish the committee as a
super&nbsp;PAC rather than a regular PAC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
</span>After submitting the form, I waited until the morning for it to be
processed by the FEC.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The next day, the
FEC emailed me to inform me that I was the treasurer of a brand-new super PAC!<o:p></o:p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
More info about banking/donations</h3>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">
To receive donations, my committee would need a
separate business bank account.&nbsp; In order to limit the number of documents
I'd need to file as Treasurer, my best course of action would have been to open
a non-interest-bearing checking account.&nbsp; Because all donations are
tax-exempt (for the recipient organization), making the account non-interest-bearing would eliminate the need for me to pay income tax on any interest
earned.&nbsp; (As far as I am aware, stock and investment earnings fall under
the IRS umbrella whereas donations are bound only to the FEC.)<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpLast">
To open a bank account, I would need an Employer
Identification Number (EIN), even if my entity employed no one.&nbsp; I went
ahead and acquired an EIN for my committee, just to get an idea of the
process.&nbsp; All it entailed was filling out a short questionnaire and typing
in some identification information.<o:p></o:p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Where is the super PAC now?</h3>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">
Other than for the exercise of going through the
filing process, having a super PAC is pointless for me, especially since I
don't expect it to receive any donations.&nbsp; In the event that I ever decide
to run for political office, I would have to turn over the super PAC anyway, so
I filed the termination report a few months ago.&nbsp; I also mailed the IRS
and told them to close the EIN / Business Account I had opened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Goodbye&nbsp;<i>Om Alone PAC</i>.</div>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
Miscellaneous thoughts</h3>
<div class="MsoNormalCxSpFirst">
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The super PAC process was extremely simple, and I
could do it again if I wanted to.</li>
<li>The entire FEC website was very easy to navigate and even has a public API and community on Github.</li>
<li>I filed a tech support ticket when the form
application was not working, and the lady working at the FEC helpdesk
immediately called me and helped me resolve my problem.</li>
<li>That anyone (including a 16-year-old) can create a
super PAC is comical.</li>
<li>That corporations and lobbies can donate unlimited
amounts of money to influence politics is dangerous for our democracy.</li>
<li>According to the Associated Press, the word
"super" in "super PAC" should not be capitalized.</li>
<li>The IRS customer service representatives were extremely
helpful and guided me on what I needed to send to the official IRS office in Ogden,
Utah in order to close my EIN / Business Account.</li>
